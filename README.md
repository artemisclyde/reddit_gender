# Study on gender stereotypes on Reddit

This is the code used for my bachelor thesis. The thesis aims at detecting gender stereotypes, hence called gender bias, hidden in different topics across the Reddit community. As a brief example, I analyse amongst others the topics *family* and *politics*, both consisting of a greater subset of Subreddits concerning that topic. In these two I hypothesize a very different gender bias, strongly skewed towards male for *politics* and towards female for *family* to be precise. I analyse this bias using the **word2vec** algorithm for learning word vectors from unannotated text data. I use **tfidf** scores to determine the words most unique for a certain topic and analyse the relative position of their representing vectors in the learned vector space. Based on the assumption that these vectors contain a lot of semantic information and relations between words, we use the similarity of those representing vectors to the vectors for *he* and *she* to calculate the proportion of their meaning linked to either gender and analyse the distributions resulting from each topic.
